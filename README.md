Final Paper of BBA of Finance to build an hybrid model using fibbonacci retracements and financial multiples for swing trade


The present work aimed to compare the performance of strategies built from a computational model for building binary positions in the Brazilian stock market. This model was trained on a base of factors, derived from the union of fundamental analysis techniques with technical analysis, indicating buy and sell positions and analyzing the positions built against the performed return of the assets. The relative valuation of EBITDA multiples and Price/Earnings multiples was used to elaborate the target prices and for Fibonacci expansions and retractions to classify the current price and the target price obtained from the projection of the market value by the multiples. The factors were inserted in the construction of Bayesian predictive models based on decision trees. The assertiveness of the model regarding the prediction of price increases and decreases in future periods was tested, obtaining assertiveness above 50% for long-term forecasts, with 90 periods of difference. In addition, the normality of the daily returns obtained in each of the nodes was also tested, obtaining normal distributions. The performance of the assets was compared against the buy and sell positions, predicted by the model, and a result poorly correlated with the market was obtained for all nodes of the trees.
